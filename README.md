# Collatz Conjecture

This is a bit of a silly obsession of mine, this simple script just tests integers from a set start point until it is forced to stop.


## Usage

```bash
py ./collatz.py
```
The script will prompt you to then enter your starting integer (if you restart the script to move logs out). IF by some miracle you ever reach an integer that halts the script then use
```bash
py ./investigate.py
```
and enter the integer in question. This will print out a log of the number sequence until it is manually stopped or reaches one causing the verification to fail.
